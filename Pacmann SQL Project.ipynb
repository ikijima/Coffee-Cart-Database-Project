    "As an IT consultant tasked with designing a robust database system for a coffee startup with multiple mobile coffee carts distributed throughout Jakarta, I would take the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Understand the Requirements and Business Model**\n",
    "   - **Sales Tracking**: The business operates through carts that sell ready-to-drink coffee. Each cart may have its own sales transactions, and sales data must be tied to the location and cart.\n",
    "   - **Inventory Management**: Each cart has an inventory (cups of coffee and other items). Inventory tracking is essential to know how much coffee is available per cart at any given time.\n",
    "   - **Customer Management**: The startup might want to gather customer data for loyalty programs or marketing purposes.\n",
    "   - **Payment Handling**: Support for different payment types (cash, digital wallets, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Multi-location**: There are multiple coffee carts, so the system should track location-specific data.\n",
    "   - **Real-Time Reporting**: Managers need real-time insights into sales and inventory across all carts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Key Data Entities**\n",
    "   Based on the requirements, we can identify the following key entities for the database schema:\n",
    "   - **Carts**: Represents each coffee cart (ID, name/identifier, location).\n",
    "   - **Products**: Represents the coffee or other items sold (Product ID, Name, Type, Price, Stock).\n",
    "   - **Sales**: Represents each transaction made (Sale ID, Cart ID, Product ID, Quantity, Total Price, Timestamp, Payment Method).\n",
    "   - **Inventory**: Represents stock levels at each cart (Inventory ID, Cart ID, Product ID, Stock Level, Restock Date).\n",
    "   - **Employees**: Cart operators (Employee ID, Name, Cart ID).\n",
    "   - **Customers**: If customer loyalty or feedback is tracked (Customer ID, Name, Email, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Payments**: If integrated payment data is needed (Payment ID, Sale ID, Payment Method, Amount).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Database Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Carts Table**: Stores information about each coffee cart.\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE carts (\n",
    "         cart_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         cart_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "         location VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "         status VARCHAR(20) -- Active, Inactive, etc.\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Products Table**: Stores information about each coffee product (e.g., latte, cappuccino, etc.).\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "         product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         product_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "         price DECIMAL(5,2),\n",
    "         description TEXT,\n",
    "         stock_level INT\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Sales Table**: Records each sale made by the carts.\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE sales (\n",
    "         sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         cart_id INT REFERENCES carts(cart_id),\n",
    "         product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),\n",
    "         quantity INT,\n",
    "         total_price DECIMAL(10,2),\n",
    "         sale_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\n",
    "         payment_method VARCHAR(20) -- Cash, Digital Wallet, etc.\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Inventory Table**: Manages stock levels for each cart.\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE inventory (\n",
    "         inventory_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         cart_id INT REFERENCES carts(cart_id),\n",
    "         product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),\n",
    "         stock_level INT,\n",
    "         last_restock TIMESTAMP\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - **Employees Table**: Assigns employees to specific carts.\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "         employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         employee_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "         cart_id INT REFERENCES carts(cart_id),\n",
    "         role VARCHAR(20)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Data Relationships**\n",
    "   - **Carts to Sales**: One cart can have multiple sales, hence a one-to-many relationship between `carts` and `sales`.\n",
    "   - **Products to Sales**: One product can appear in many sales, so there’s a one-to-many relationship between `products` and `sales`.\n",
    "   - **Carts to Inventory**: One cart can track multiple products' stock, so there’s a one-to-many relationship between `carts` and `inventory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Real-Time Data Integration**\n",
    "   - **POS System**: Equip each cart with a point-of-sale (POS) system that connects to the database via cloud infrastructure. This will allow sales data and inventory changes to be reflected in real-time across the entire operation.\n",
    "   - **Mobile-Friendly Interface**: Develop a mobile or tablet app interface for the cart operators to manage sales and view stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Inventory Management**\n",
    "   - Inventory levels need to be tracked in real time. When a sale occurs, the stock level in the `inventory` table should decrease automatically.\n",
    "   - Set up automatic restock alerts when inventory for any cart falls below a certain threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Payment System Integration**\n",
    "   - Integrate digital payment methods (e.g., QR code payments like GoPay, Ovo) into the system.\n",
    "   - Each sale record should store the payment method and any transaction reference numbers for reconciliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Analytics and Reporting**\n",
    "   - **Daily Sales Reports**: Generate sales reports showing revenue by cart, by product, and by employee.\n",
    "   - **Inventory Reports**: Show current stock levels and historical restocking data.\n",
    "   - **Performance Metrics**: Sales per cart, top-selling products, peak sales times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Technology Stack**\n",
    "   - **Database**: PostgreSQL (ideal for scalability, and has strong support for relational data).\n",
    "   - **Backend**: Python (with frameworks like Django or Flask) to interact with the database and provide API endpoints for the mobile or POS app.\n",
    "   - **Cloud Infrastructure**: Use AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL to ensure scalability and availability.\n",
    "   - **POS System Integration**: Use a mobile app interface built in Flutter or React Native for the cart operators, connecting to the backend APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Security and Backup**\n",
    "   - Ensure secure connections between carts and the central database using HTTPS/SSL encryption.\n",
    "   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict database access to authorized employees.\n",
    "   - Set up automated daily backups to prevent data loss in case of a system failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Scalability**\n",
    "   - The system should be designed to easily scale if the number of carts or locations increases. Cloud-based solutions will help manage this scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The proposed system is a scalable, real-time solution that allows for detailed tracking of sales and inventory across multiple locations. It supports future growth and allows for integration with customer loyalty programs and digital payments, making it a robust choice for a growing startup."

    "To manage the raw material inventory (e.g., coffee beans, milk, syrups) and integrate it with daily production and periodic purchases, I'd expand the existing database system. This will involve adding new tables for raw materials, tracking their consumption, linking them to production (cups sold), and handling purchase prices that may vary over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I would approach it:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **New Requirements**\n",
    "   - **Raw Material Inventory**: Track the stock of each raw material (e.g., coffee beans, milk).\n",
    "   - **Daily Consumption**: Link the production of coffee drinks to the consumption of raw materials.\n",
    "   - **Purchases**: Track raw material purchases, including supplier information and varying prices.\n",
    "   - **Stock Alerts**: Automatically generate alerts when raw materials fall below a critical threshold.\n",
    "   - **Costing**: Track the total cost of raw materials per production day and adjust profitability calculations based on varying purchase prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **New Entities for Raw Material Management**\n",
    "To accommodate raw materials and their variable costs, the database schema needs new tables to store:\n",
    "   - **Raw Materials**: Information about the materials (e.g., coffee beans, milk).\n",
    "   - **Raw Material Purchases**: Record purchases with prices and suppliers.\n",
    "   - **Raw Material Consumption**: Track how much of each material is used daily for production.\n",
    "   - **Suppliers**: Information about suppliers for raw materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Database Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Raw Materials Table**\n",
    "This table will store the types of raw materials.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE raw_materials (\n",
    "    raw_material_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    material_name VARCHAR(50), -- Coffee beans, UHT milk, etc.\n",
    "    unit VARCHAR(20), -- e.g., kg, liters\n",
    "    stock_level DECIMAL(10,2), -- Amount of material in stock\n",
    "    reorder_threshold DECIMAL(10,2) -- Level at which reorder alert is triggered\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Raw Material Purchases Table**\n",
    "This table will track purchases of raw materials, including varying prices.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE raw_material_purchases (\n",
    "    purchase_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    raw_material_id INT REFERENCES raw_materials(raw_material_id),\n",
    "    supplier_id INT REFERENCES suppliers(supplier_id),\n",
    "    quantity DECIMAL(10,2), -- Amount purchased\n",
    "    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2), -- Price per unit for this purchase\n",
    "    purchase_date DATE,\n",
    "    total_cost AS (quantity * unit_price), -- Automatically calculated\n",
    "    received_date DATE -- Date when material is received and added to stock\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c. **Suppliers Table**\n",
    "This stores information about suppliers from which raw materials are purchased.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE suppliers (\n",
    "    supplier_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    supplier_name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    contact_info TEXT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d. **Raw Material Consumption Table**\n",
    "This table tracks the daily consumption of raw materials based on production.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE raw_material_consumption (\n",
    "    consumption_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    raw_material_id INT REFERENCES raw_materials(raw_material_id),\n",
    "    cart_id INT REFERENCES carts(cart_id), -- Optional: Track consumption per cart\n",
    "    quantity_used DECIMAL(10,2),\n",
    "    consumption_date DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Tracking Raw Material Usage and Production**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a. **Recipe Table (Linking Products to Raw Materials)**\n",
    "To connect the production of coffee drinks with raw material consumption, I would create a **Recipe Table**. Each product (coffee drink) would have a set of raw materials and their required quantities (e.g., a latte requires 0.03 kg of coffee beans and 0.25 liters of milk).\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE recipes (\n",
    "    recipe_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),\n",
    "    raw_material_id INT REFERENCES raw_materials(raw_material_id),\n",
    "    quantity_per_unit DECIMAL(10,2) -- Amount of raw material used per product unit\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time a coffee drink is sold (tracked in the **Sales Table**), the corresponding raw material consumption can be automatically deducted from the inventory using the information in the **Recipe Table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b. **Daily Production Calculation**\n",
    "To calculate the daily raw material consumption based on sales, you could sum the total units sold for each product and multiply by the raw materials required, as defined in the **Recipe Table**. This would be recorded in the **Raw Material Consumption Table**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Example query to calculate raw material consumption for a product\n",
    "SELECT r.raw_material_id, SUM(s.quantity * r.quantity_per_unit) AS total_consumed\n",
    "FROM sales s\n",
    "JOIN recipes r ON s.product_id = r.product_id\n",
    "WHERE s.sale_timestamp::DATE = CURRENT_DATE\n",
    "GROUP BY r.raw_material_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Handling Varying Prices for Raw Material Purchases**\n",
    "Each time raw materials are purchased, the price per unit might differ (e.g., due to supplier changes or market fluctuations). This variability is handled in the **Raw Material Purchases Table**, which stores the purchase price for each batch of materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating the total cost of production for a given period, use a **weighted average** or **FIFO (First In, First Out)** approach to account for different purchase prices. For example, when coffee beans are consumed, the system could deduct from the oldest stock (purchased at a specific price) first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Example to calculate the average price of coffee beans on hand\n",
    "SELECT raw_material_id, SUM(quantity * unit_price) / SUM(quantity) AS avg_price\n",
    "FROM raw_material_purchases\n",
    "WHERE raw_material_id = 1 -- For coffee beans\n",
    "GROUP BY raw_material_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Periodic Raw Material Purchases**\n",
    "When stock levels fall below the reorder threshold, the system should flag the material for reorder and notify the purchasing department.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automatic Restock Alerts\n",
    "When the stock level falls below the threshold defined in the **Raw Materials Table**, generate an alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Example query to find materials below reorder threshold\n",
    "SELECT material_name, stock_level, reorder_threshold\n",
    "FROM raw_materials\n",
    "WHERE stock_level < reorder_threshold;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The purchasing team would then place an order, record it in the **Raw Material Purchases Table**, and adjust stock levels upon receiving the materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Costs Integration**\n",
    "#### a. **Cost per Cup**\n",
    "To calculate the cost of producing a cup of coffee, sum the cost of raw materials used based on their purchase price. For each product, the raw materials used are recorded in the **Recipe Table**, and their costs are taken from the latest purchase batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Example query to calculate production cost per product\n",
    "SELECT p.product_name, SUM(r.quantity_per_unit * rp.unit_price) AS cost_per_unit\n",
    "FROM recipes r\n",
    "JOIN raw_material_purchases rp ON r.raw_material_id = rp.raw_material_id\n",
    "JOIN products p ON r.product_id = p.product_id\n",
    "WHERE rp.purchase_date <= CURRENT_DATE -- Ensure we use only received stock\n",
    "GROUP BY p.product_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Final Architecture**\n",
    "The overall architecture now has:\n",
    "   - **Carts and Sales**: Track daily sales and their impact on raw material usage.\n",
    "   - **Inventory and Purchases**: Handle both product inventory (coffee sold) and raw material inventory (beans, milk, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Suppliers and Varying Prices**: Track raw material purchases and their cost variations over time.\n",
    "   - **Production Cost**: Calculate the actual production cost per unit and use this to adjust pricing or profitability metrics.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "This extended database system provides a comprehensive solution for managing raw materials, from inventory tracking to usage, purchasing, and cost management. By tracking raw material consumption at the recipe level and considering varying purchase prices, the system ensures accurate inventory control and cost optimization, supporting the coffee startup’s operational needs efficiently."

    "### Script Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Libraries**: \n",
    "   - `Faker` is used to generate fake data like sale timestamps and unique IDs.\n",
    "   - `pandas` is used to structure the data and export it to CSV.\n",
    "   - `datetime` and `timedelta` are used to iterate through each day in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Locations**:\n",
    "   - The carts start in **Central Jakarta** with 3 locations, then expand to 9 carts, including **South Jakarta** locations as the business grows.\n",
    "   - Locations are kept realistic by using well-known neighborhoods in Jakarta.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cart and Product Expansion**:\n",
    "   - The script simulates the expansion of the business from 3 to 9 carts starting from April 2023.\n",
    "   - Each cart starts with an inventory of **200 cups**, and it sells between **20 to 80 cups per day**.\n",
    "   - Products include different variations of iced coffee, some of which use syrups (Vanilla, Hazelnut, Aren).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sales Data**:\n",
    "   - The `generate_sales_data` function iterates through each day of 2023 and creates random sales for each cart.\n",
    "   - For each sale, a random product is chosen, and the total price is calculated based on the quantity sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CSV Export**:\n",
    "   - After generating the sales data, the script exports the data into a CSV file named `coffee_sales_2023.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CSV Columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sale_id`: Unique identifier for each sale.\n",
    "- `cart_id`: The ID of the cart that made the sale.\n",
    "- `product`: The name of the coffee product sold.\n",
    "- `quantity_sold`: How many cups were sold in that transaction.\n",
    "- `total_price`: Total price for the transaction.\n",
    "- `sale_timestamp`: Timestamp of when the sale occurred.\n",
    "- `location`: Location of the cart.\n",
    "- `area`: Whether the cart was in **Central Jakarta** or **South Jakarta**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customizing Data:\n",
    "You can adjust the parameters for sales counts, locations, prices, or the timeline of cart expansion depending on your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script generates a full year's worth of data, simulating the expansion of the coffee cart business, and makes it ready for importing into a database for further analysis or operations."

    "### Explanation of the Tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **raw_materials**:\n",
    "   - Stores the raw materials (e.g., Coffee Beans, UHT Milk, etc.) and their measurement units (e.g., grams, liters).\n",

    "2. **raw_materials_purchases**:\n",
    "   - Tracks the purchases of raw materials, including the date, supplier, quantity purchased, and price per unit (allowing price fluctuations).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **recipes**:\n",
    "   - Maps each product to its corresponding raw materials, with the quantity of each raw material required to make one unit (cup) of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **raw_materials_consumption**:\n",
    "   - Links the sales data to the raw materials consumed in each sale. For each sale, this table records the quantity of raw materials used based on the product recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purchasing Raw Materials**: When raw materials are bought (e.g., 5000g of Coffee Beans), they are recorded in the `raw_materials_purchases` table.\n",
    "- **Making Sales**: When a sale is made, the `raw_materials_consumption` table is updated to reflect the raw materials consumed according to the product's recipe.\n",
    "- **Recipe Management**: The `recipes` table ensures that you know how much of each raw material is used for each product.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Sales Data**:\n",
    "   - The script generates sales records, including a unique `sale_id`, the date and time of the sale, the cart's location, the product sold, and the price of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Raw Materials Consumption**:\n",
    "   - After generating each sale, the script references the `recipes` dictionary to determine the raw materials and quantities used for that specific product.\n",
    "   - For each material in the product’s recipe, an entry is added to the `raw_materials_consumption` list, containing the `sale_id`, `material_id`, and `quantity_used`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Faker**:\n",
    "   - `Faker` is used to generate random sales data such as timestamps and product choices, while quantities for raw materials are consistent with the predefined recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Two CSV files are generated: \n",
    "     - `sales_data.csv` containing the sales records.\n",
    "     - `raw_materials_consumption.csv` containing the raw materials used per sale.\n",

    "To incorporate the `payments` table into the script, you would need to generate payment data for each sale. The payments could be recorded at the same time as the sales or at a later time (depending on whether you want to simulate immediate or delayed payments). For simplicity, let’s assume that each sale generates a corresponding payment at the time of sale.\n",

    "### Breakdown of Changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Payment Data Generation**:\n",
    "   - For each sale, the script generates a corresponding payment using the `payment_id` (a unique UUID) and links it to the `sale_id`.\n",
    "   - The payment time is the same as the sale time (`payment_time = sale_time`).\n",
    "   - The `amount` field is the price of the product, and the `payment_method` is randomly selected from the list `[\"Cash\", \"Card\", \"E-wallet\"]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Three CSV files will now be generated:\n",
    "     - `sales_data.csv`: Contains the sales data as before.\n",
    "     - `raw_materials_consumption.csv`: Contains the raw materials used in each sale, as per the product's recipe.\n",
    "     - `payments.csv`: Contains the payment data linked to each sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of the `payments.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "payment_id,sale_id,payment_date,amount,payment_method\n",
    "e4567890-12ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef,e1234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef,2023-01-02 09:15:45,25000,Cash\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing into PostgreSQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've generated the `payments.csv`, you can import it into PostgreSQL using the same `COPY` command or an equivalent import method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "COPY payments FROM '/path/to/payments.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;\n",
    "```\n",

    "No worries at all! You're right—introducing an `order` table would improve the database design, especially in situations where a customer may purchase multiple items in a single order. This will allow for better normalization and avoid redundant data. Here's a revised approach to incorporate the `order` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Revised Database Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`order` Table**:\n",
    "   - `order_id`: Unique identifier for the order.\n",
    "   - `customer_id`: Identifier for the customer (if applicable).\n",
    "   - `sale_timestamp`: Timestamp of the order.\n",
    "   - `payment_method`: The method used for payment (`Cash`, `Card`, `E-wallet`).\n",
    "   - `cart_id`: Which cart the order was placed at (this ties the order to the cart).\n",
    "   - `location`: The location where the cart is placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Revised `sales` Table** (Now `order_items`):\n",
    "   - `order_item_id`: Unique identifier for each sale item.\n",
    "   - `order_id`: Reference to the `order` table.\n",
    "   - `product_id`: The ID of the product that was purchased.\n",
    "   - `quantity`: The number of units purchased for each item.\n",
    "   - `price`: The price of each product (which could vary if there are discounts, promotions, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure ensures:\n",
    "- The `order` table holds general information about the entire order (customer, time, payment method, etc.).\n",
    "- The `order_items` table lists each individual item in the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updated Database Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`order` Table**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id UUID,  -- Optional if you want to track customers\n",
    "    sale_timestamp TIMESTAMP,\n",
    "    payment_method VARCHAR(20),  -- e.g., 'Cash', 'Card', 'E-wallet'\n",
    "    cart_id INT REFERENCES carts(cart_id),\n",
    "    location VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`order_items` Table** (Formerly `sales`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE order_items (\n",
    "    order_item_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(order_id),\n",
    "    product_id INT REFERENCES products(product_id),\n",
    "    quantity INT DEFAULT 1,  -- Quantity of the product sold\n",
    "    price DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",

    "### Breakdown of the Script:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`orders_data` Generation**:\n",
    "   - Generates a record for each order in the `orders` table, including fields such as `order_id`, `customer_id` (optional), `sale_timestamp`, `payment_method`, `cart_id`, and `location`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`order_items_data` Generation**:\n",
    "   - For each order, 1–5 products are added to the `order_items` table, with fields like `order_item_id`, `order_id` (linked to the `orders` table), `product_id`, `quantity`, and `price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **File Outputs**:\n",
    "   - **`orders.csv`**: Contains the order-level data.\n",
    "   - **`order_items.csv`**: Contains the individual items purchased in each order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of the `orders.csv`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```csv\n",
    "order_id,customer_id,sale_timestamp,payment_method,cart_id,location\n",

    "\n",
    "### Removing Redundant Columns in the `order_items` Table:\n",
    "Since the `order_items` table now links to `orders`, the fields such as `cart_id`, `location`, and `sale_timestamp` are no longer necessary in the `order_items` table. This ensures a more normalized and efficient structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the `orders` table handles the general order details, and the `order_items` table tracks the products in each order."

    "1. **Generate `orders.csv`**:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Generate `sales.csv`** (or `order_items.csv`):\n",
    "   - Once the `orders` table is created, generate the corresponding items for each order based on the `products` the customer purchased, and store them in the `order_items` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate `raw_materials_consumption.csv`**:\n",
    "   - Use the data from the `order_items` table and match the product with the `recipes` table to calculate the raw material consumption for each item sold, then populate this table.\n",

    "### Key Changes and Additions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Carts Table**:\n",
    "   - **`carts.csv`** will contain 3 carts initially and will expand to 9 carts halfway through the year (split between Central and South Jakarta).\n",
    "   - The `carts.csv` includes `cart_id`, `location`, and `assigned_employee_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Employees Table**:\n",
    "   - Random employees are generated and stored in **`employees.csv`** with `employee_id`, `name`, and `role`.\n",
    "   - Employees are randomly assigned to carts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Orders and Order Items (Sales)**:\n",
    "   - Orders are generated per cart, with random customers, products, and payment methods.\n",
    "   - Products sold are linked to the `order_items.csv`, which contains details of each item sold in an order.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Raw Materials Consumption**:\n",
    "   - Based on the `recipes` for each product sold, the **`raw_materials_consumption.csv`** table tracks how much of each raw material is consumed per order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output CSV Files\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanation of Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Generating the `carts` Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function `generate_carts()`**:\n",
    "  - Starts with **3 carts** on **January 1, 2023**.\n",
    "  - Expands to **9 carts** throughout the year, adding new carts at different dates.\n",
    "  - Assigns each cart to a location in **Central Jakarta** or **South Jakarta**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Generating the `employees` Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function `generate_employees(carts)`**:\n",
    "  - Assigns **1-2 employees** per cart.\n",
    "  - Employees have details: `employee_id`, `name`, `cart_id`, `start_date`, and `position`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Generating `orders`, `order_details`, and `raw_materials_consumption` Tables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Function `generate_orders_sales_and_consumption(carts, employees)`**:\n",
    "  - Generates orders only for carts that are operational on the given date.\n",
    "  - Associates each order with a cart and an employee.\n",
    "  - Each order can contain **1-5 products**.\n",
    "  - Calculates raw material consumption based on the `recipes` and quantities sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Ensuring Locations are in Central or South Jakarta:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Locations are chosen from realistic neighborhoods within **Central Jakarta** and **South Jakarta**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Tables and CSV Files:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. `carts.csv`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fields: `cart_id`, `start_date`, `location`, `area`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. `employees.csv`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fields: `employee_id`, `name`, `cart_id`, `start_date`, `position`\n",

    "### Loading Data into the Database:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've generated the CSV files, you can use SQL scripts to create the tables and load the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SQL Scripts to Create Tables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create carts table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE carts (\n",
    "    cart_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    start_date DATE,\n",
    "    location VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    area VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Create employees table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    cart_id INT REFERENCES carts(cart_id),\n",
    "    start_date DATE,\n",

    "    order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(order_id),\n",
    "    product_id INT,\n",
    "    quantity INT,\n",
    "    price DECIMAL(10,2),\n",
    "    total_price DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Create raw_materials_consumption table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE raw_materials_consumption (\n",

    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Importing Data**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `COPY` command in PostgreSQL or equivalent commands in other databases to load data from the CSV files into the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "COPY carts FROM '/path/to/carts.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;\n",
    "COPY employees FROM '/path/to/employees.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;\n",
    "COPY orders FROM '/path/to/orders.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;\n",
    "COPY order_details FROM '/path/to/order_details.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;\n",
    "COPY raw_materials_consumption FROM '/path/to/raw_materials_consumption.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;\n",

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The updated script and database setup meet your requirements by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Populating the `carts` table with the expansion from 3 to 9 carts.\n",
    "- Populating the `employees` table, assigning employees to carts.\n",
    "- Ensuring all locations are realistic and within Central or South Jakarta.\n",
    "- Generating the `orders` table based on carts and employees.\n",
    "- Generating the `order_details` table according to the `orders` table.\n",
