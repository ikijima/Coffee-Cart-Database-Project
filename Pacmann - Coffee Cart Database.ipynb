    "Sure! For a coffee-on-the-go business with multiple carts, you’ll want a database structure that captures various aspects of your operations, including carts, products, sales, and customers. Here's a suggested schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Carts**\n",
    "   - **cart_id** (Primary Key)\n",
    "   - **location** (e.g., address or coordinates)\n",
    "   - **manager_name**\n",
    "   - **operational_hours**\n",
    "   - **contact_info**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Products**\n",
    "   - **product_id** (Primary Key)\n",
    "   - **name**\n",
    "   - **description**\n",
    "   - **price**\n",
    "   - **category** (e.g., coffee, pastries)\n",
    "   - **inventory_count**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sales**\n",
    "   - **sale_id** (Primary Key)\n",
    "   - **cart_id** (Foreign Key to Carts)\n",
    "   - **customer_id** (Foreign Key to Customers, nullable for walk-ups)\n",
    "   - **sale_date** (timestamp)\n",
    "   - **total_amount**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sale_Items**\n",
    "   - **sale_item_id** (Primary Key)\n",

    "   - **product_id** (Foreign Key to Products)\n",
    "   - **quantity**\n",
    "   - **price_at_sale** (to capture price at the time of sale)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Customers**\n",
    "   - **customer_id** (Primary Key)\n",
    "   - **name**\n",
    "   - **email** (optional)\n",
    "   - **loyalty_points** (optional for a loyalty program)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Carts to Sales**: One-to-Many\n",
    "  - A cart can have multiple sales, but each sale is associated with one cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales to Sale_Items**: One-to-Many\n",
    "  - Each sale can consist of multiple items, but each sale item is linked to one sale.\n",

    "- **Products to Sale_Items**: One-to-Many\n",
    "  - Each product can be sold in many sale items, but each sale item is linked to one product.\n",

    "- **Customers to Sales**: One-to-Many\n",

    "\n",
    "### Sample Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Get total sales for a specific cart:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT SUM(total_amount) \n",
    "   FROM Sales \n",
    "   WHERE cart_id = ?;\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "2. **Get inventory count of all products:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT name, inventory_count \n",
    "   FROM Products;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Get sales history for a specific customer:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT S.sale_date, SI.product_id, SI.quantity, SI.price_at_sale \n",
    "   FROM Sales S\n",
    "   JOIN Sale_Items SI ON S.sale_id = SI.sale_id\n",
    "   WHERE S.customer_id = ?;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inventory Management**: You might want to implement triggers or stored procedures to automatically adjust the `inventory_count` in the Products table when a sale is made.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Sales Reporting**: Consider adding views or additional tables for reporting purposes, like daily or monthly sales summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loyalty Program**: If you plan to implement a loyalty program, you could extend the Customers table to include additional fields for tracking points and rewards.\n",
