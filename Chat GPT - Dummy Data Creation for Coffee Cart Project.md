# Chat GPT - Dummy Data Creation for Coffee Cart Project

## Data generation for parent tables (suppliers, users, carts, products, ingredients)

Certainly! I'll structure the code to use a dictionary format for each table (like `table_users`) where each key is a column name. Each table's data will be directly populated in this dictionary format. This style is very readable and maintains clarity for each table’s data generation.

Regarding **Faker's seed**: Setting a seed with `Faker.seed()` ensures that the randomly generated values are reproducible each time you run the script. This is useful when testing, as it provides consistent data across runs, which is helpful for debugging or when you need to maintain the same dummy data in your database setup.

I’ll integrate `Faker.seed()` into the script and structure the code as you suggested.

Here’s the code:

```python
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()
Faker.seed(42)  # Ensures repeatable results across script runs

# Define table structures with placeholders for each column

# Suppliers table
table_suppliers = {
    'supplier_id': [],
    'supplier_name': [],
    'supplier_address': [],
    'supplier_phone': [],
    'supplier_email': []
}

for _ in range(10):
    table_suppliers['supplier_id'].append(None)  # SERIAL field, assumed auto-incremented in DB
    table_suppliers['supplier_name'].append(fake.company())
    table_suppliers['supplier_address'].append(fake.address())
    table_suppliers['supplier_phone'].append(fake.phone_number())
    table_suppliers['supplier_email'].append(fake.unique.company_email())

# Users table
table_users = {
    'user_id': [],
    'name': [],
    'email': [],
    'loyalty_points': [],
    'discount_eligibility': [],
    'phone_number': []
}

for _ in range(50):
    table_users['user_id'].append(None)  # SERIAL field
    table_users['name'].append(fake.name())
    table_users['email'].append(fake.unique.email())
    table_users['loyalty_points'].append(random.randint(0, 100))
    table_users['discount_eligibility'].append(random.choice([True, False]))
    table_users['phone_number'].append(fake.phone_number())

# Carts table with location setup and bi-monthly addition of carts
table_carts = {
    'cart_id': [],
    'location': [],
    'employee_id': []
}

for i in range(6):
    month_added = i * 2 + 1
    table_carts['cart_id'].append(None)  # SERIAL field
    table_carts['location'].append(f"{random.choice(['Central Jakarta', 'Southern Jakarta'])} - District {random.choice(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])}")
    table_carts['employee_id'].append(random.randint(1, 50))

# Products table
products = ["Iced Americano", "Iced Latte", "Iced Vanilla Latte", "Iced Hazelnut Latte", "Iced Aren Latte", "Iced Matcha Latte"]

table_products = {
    'product_id': [],
    'product_name': [# ],
    'price': [],
    'product_cost': [],
    'description': []
}

for product in products:
    table_products['product_id'].append(None)  # SERIAL field
    table_products['product_name'].append(product)
    table_products['price'].append(round(random.uniform(2.5, 5.0), 2))
    table_products['product_cost'].append(round(random.uniform(1.0, 2.5), 2))
    table_products['description'].append(fake.sentence())

# Ingredients table
ingredients_list = ["Coffee Beans", "Milk", "Sugar", "Ice", "Vanilla Syrup", "Hazelnut Syrup", "Aren Syrup", "Matcha Powder"]
table_ingredients = {
    'ingredient_id': [],
    'ingredient_name': [],
    'metrics': []
}

for ingredient in ingredients_list:
    table_ingredients['ingredient_id'].append(None)  # SERIAL field
    table_ingredients['ingredient_name'].append(ingredient)
    table_ingredients['metrics'].append(random.choice(["grams", "milliliters"]))

# Recipes table
table_recipes = {
    'recipe_id': [],
    'product_id': [],
    'ingredient_id': [],
    'quantity': []
}

for _ in range(18):  # Example: 18 recipes
    table_recipes['recipe_id'].append(None)  # SERIAL field
    table_recipes['product_id'].append(random.randint(1, len(products)))
    table_recipes['ingredient_id'].append(random.randint(1, len(ingredients_list)))
    table_recipes['quantity'].append(round(random.uniform(10, 50), 2))

# Display the generated data
print("Suppliers Data:", table_suppliers)
print("Users Data:", table_users)
print("Carts Data:", table_carts)
print("Products Data:", table_products)
print("Ingredients Data:", table_ingredients)
print("Recipes Data:", table_recipes)
```

### Explanation

1. **Table Structures**: Each table is defined as a dictionary with columns as keys and empty lists as values. Each list will hold data for a respective column.

2. **Data Generation**:
   
   - **`table_suppliers`, `table_users`, etc.**: Populate each column directly using loops.
   - **Date Constraints for `table_carts`**: Carts are added every two months, starting from January.
   - **Reproducibility**: The `Faker.seed(42)` call at the top makes the random generation deterministic, meaning each run produces the same data.

3. **Output**: The final print statements display each table's generated data.

This structure follows your preference for clear, in-place data generation without external custom functions. Each table’s data generation is contained within one block, making it easy to modify or review.

## Generating `product_id` based on a criteria

---

Yes, you can generate the `product_id` according to these rules. Here’s an example code snippet to generate `product_id` values as described, while filling in the other fields as before:

```python
from faker import Faker
import random

fake = Faker()

products = [
    "Iced Americano",       # PR110 - Coffee, Iced, Plain
    "Iced Latte",           # PR110 - Coffee, Iced, Plain
    "Iced Vanilla Latte",   # PR111 - Coffee, Iced, Vanilla
    "Iced Hazelnut Latte",  # PR112 - Coffee, Iced, Hazelnut
    "Iced Aren Latte",      # PR113 - Coffee, Iced, Aren syrup
    "Iced Matcha Latte"     # PR114 - Coffee, Iced, Matcha
]

# Dictionary to hold table data
table_products = {
    'product_id': [],
    'product_name': [],
    'price': [],
    'product_cost': [],
    'description': []
}

# Map product names to product ID specifications
product_id_map = {
    "Iced Americano": "PR110",
    "Iced Latte": "PR110",
    "Iced Vanilla Latte": "PR111",
    "Iced Hazelnut Latte": "PR112",
    "Iced Aren Latte": "PR113",
    "Iced Matcha Latte": "PR114"
}

# Populate table data
for product in products:
    table_products['product_id'].append(product_id_map[product])
    table_products['product_name'].append(product)
    table_products['price'].append(round(random.uniform(2.5, 5.0), 2))
    table_products['product_cost'].append(round(random.uniform(1.0, 2.5), 2))
    table_products['description'].append(fake.sentence())

# Display the generated data
for i in range(len(products)):
    print(f"Product ID: {table_products['product_id'][i]}, "
          f"Name: {table_products['product_name'][i]}, "
          f"Price: ${table_products['price'][i]}, "
          f"Cost: ${table_products['product_cost'][i]}, "
          f"Description: {table_products['description'][i]}")
```

### Explanation

1. **Product ID Mapping**: A `product_id_map` dictionary defines the ID for each product according to the specified format.
2. **Data Generation**: Each product entry appends the corresponding `product_id`, `product_name`, `price`, `product_cost`, and a fake description to `table_products`.
3. **Output**: The loop at the end prints the generated data for verification.

### Notes on Extensibility

If you need to add more products with similar logic, you could update the `product_id_map` or even automate the mapping if you have a pattern based on name structure.

## Generating `user_id` based on a criteria

---

To generate `user_id` in the format `U-{date joined}-{sequence joined}`, we’ll add a "date joined" and a sequence number for each user. The sequence should reset each day. Here's how you could implement this:

1. **Generate Join Date**: For each user, assign a random "date joined" within a specific range (e.g., within 2024).
2. **Assign Sequence Number**: For each date, keep track of the sequence to ensure it resets for each new date.

Here's the updated code:

```python
from faker import Faker
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

fake = Faker()

table_users = {
    'user_id': [],
    'name': [],
    'email': [],
    'loyalty_points': [],
    'discount_eligibility': [],
    'phone_number': [],
    'date_joined': []
}

# Helper dictionary to keep track of sequence numbers for each date
user_sequence_by_date = {}

# Generate users
for _ in range(50):
    # Generate a random "date joined" in the year 2024
    start_date = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
    end_date = datetime.now()
    date_joined = fake.date_between(start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)
    date_str = date_joined.strftime("%Y%m%d")  # Format date as YYYYMMDD

    # Generate sequence number for the date
    if date_str not in user_sequence_by_date:
        user_sequence_by_date[date_str] = 1  # Start sequence for new date
    else:
        user_sequence_by_date[date_str] += 1  # Increment sequence for the date

    sequence_number = user_sequence_by_date[date_str]

    # Create user_id in the format "U-{date joined}-{sequence joined}"
    user_id = f"U-{date_str}-{sequence_number:03}"  # Zero-padded to 3 digits

    # Append to table_users
    table_users['user_id'].append(user_id)
    table_users['name'].append(fake.name())
    table_users['email'].append(fake.unique.email())
    table_users['loyalty_points'].append(random.randint(0, 100))
    table_users['discount_eligibility'].append(random.choice([True, False]))
    table_users['phone_number'].append(fake.phone_number())
    table_users['date_joined'].append(date_joined)

# Display some of the generated data
for i in range(10):  # Display only the first 10 users for brevity
    print(f"User ID: {table_users['user_id'][i]}, "
          f"Name: {table_users['name'][i]}, "
          f"Email: {table_users['email'][i]}, "
          f"Loyalty Points: {table_users['loyalty_points'][i]}, "
          f"Discount Eligibility: {table_users['discount_eligibility'][i]}, "
          f"Phone Number: {table_users['phone_number'][i]}, "
          f"Date Joined: {table_users['date_joined'][i]}")
```

### Explanation

- **Date Joined**: `fake.date_between(start_date, end_date)` generates a random date within a specified range.
- **Sequence Number**: The `user_sequence_by_date` dictionary keeps track of the current sequence number for each date, incrementing by 1 with each new user on the same date.
- **User ID Format**: `f"U-{date_str}-{sequence_number:03}"` formats the `user_id` with a zero-padded sequence number (e.g., `001`, `002`, etc.).

### Sample Output

```
User ID: U-20240101-001, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com, Loyalty Points: 45, Discount Eligibility: True, Phone Number: (555) 555-1234, Date Joined: 2024-01-01
User ID: U-20240101-002, Name: Jane Smith, Email: jane.smith@example.com, Loyalty Points: 87, Discount Eligibility: False, Phone Number: (555) 555-5678, Date Joined: 2024-01-01
...
```

This code provides sequential `user_id`s that follow your specified format and ensures uniqueness for each user.

## Generating data to get `part_of_day` `morning`, `afternoon`, etc when generating sales data

---

In both SQL and Python, you would typically define custom logic to determine the part of the day based on a time range. Here’s how you can do it in each:

### In Python

You can define a function that takes the start and end times, calculates the total duration, and checks the start and end times to categorize the part of the day:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def get_part_of_day(time_start, time_end):
    # Define parts of the day ranges
    parts_of_day = {
        'morning': (6, 12),
        'afternoon': (12, 18),
        'evening': (18, 24),
        'night': (0, 6)
    }

    # Parse input times
    start_hour = time_start.hour
    end_hour = time_end.hour

    # Identify part of the day based on the start time
    for part, (start_range, end_range) in parts_of_day.items():
        if start_range <= start_hour < end_range:
            return part

# Example usage
time_start = datetime.strptime('2024-11-13 10:00:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
time_end = datetime.strptime('2024-11-13 13:00:00', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

part_of_day = get_part_of_day(time_start, time_end)
print(part_of_day)  # Output should be 'morning' or 'afternoon' depending on your definition
```

This function categorizes based on `time_start`, so it will classify the period by when it begins. You can adjust the logic if you’d like it to consider `time_end` as well.

### In SQL

In SQL, you would use a `CASE` statement to check the hour and classify it into parts of the day. Here’s an example in PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT 
    time_start,
    time_end,
    EXTRACT(hour FROM time_start) AS start_hour,
    CASE 
        WHEN EXTRACT(hour FROM time_start) BETWEEN 6 AND 11 THEN 'morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(hour FROM time_start) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'afternoon'
        WHEN EXTRACT(hour FROM time_start) BETWEEN 18 AND 23 THEN 'evening'
        ELSE 'night'
    END AS part_of_day
FROM your_table;
```

This query uses `time_start` to determine the part of the day. You can replace `time_start` with `time_end` if you want to categorize by the end time.

# Dummy Data for Recipes
---

To create recipes for each drink that target a 200ml serving, I'll base each drink's recipe on its main ingredients, assigning quantities based on typical proportions for these types of beverages. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **`Iced Americano`**: Coffee and ice (no milk or syrups).
2. **`Iced Latte`**: Coffee, milk, and ice.
3. **`Iced Aren Latte`**: Coffee, milk, Aren syrup, and ice.
4. **`Iced Vanilla Latte`**: Coffee, milk, vanilla syrup, and ice.
5. **`Iced Hazelnut Latte`**: Coffee, milk, hazelnut syrup, and ice.

Each recipe will aim for approximately 200ml in total volume, and I’ll allocate typical ingredient ratios for the drink types. Here’s an example of how you could define these recipes for each drink, with `quantity` representing the amount in milliliters or grams as appropriate.

### Example Recipes

Assuming `product_id`s for each drink and `ingredient_id`s for each ingredient are already assigned, the following setup could work:

```sql
-- Iced Americano (200ml total: 150ml water, 50g ice, 10g coffee beans)
INSERT INTO recipes (product_id, ingredient_id, quantity)
VALUES 
    (1, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Coffee Beans'), 10),
    (1, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Ice'), 50),
    (1, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Water'), 150);

-- Iced Latte (200ml total: 100ml milk, 50ml water, 50g ice, 10g coffee beans)
INSERT INTO recipes (product_id, ingredient_id, quantity)
VALUES 
    (2, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Coffee Beans'), 10),
    (2, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Ice'), 50),
    (2, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Milk'), 100),
    (2, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Water'), 50);

-- Iced Aren Latte (200ml total: 90ml milk, 50ml water, 10ml aren syrup, 50g ice, 10g coffee beans)
INSERT INTO recipes (product_id, ingredient_id, quantity)
VALUES 
    (3, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Coffee Beans'), 10),
    (3, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Ice'), 50),
    (3, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Milk'), 90),
    (3, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Water'), 50),
    (3, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Aren Syrup'), 10);

-- Iced Vanilla Latte (200ml total: 90ml milk, 50ml water, 10ml vanilla syrup, 50g ice, 10g coffee beans)
INSERT INTO recipes (product_id, ingredient_id, quantity)
VALUES 
    (4, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Coffee Beans'), 10),
    (4, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Ice'), 50),
    (4, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Milk'), 90),
    (4, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Water'), 50),
    (4, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Vanilla Syrup'), 10);

-- Iced Hazelnut Latte (200ml total: 90ml milk, 50ml water, 10ml hazelnut syrup, 50g ice, 10g coffee beans)
INSERT INTO recipes (product_id, ingredient_id, quantity)
VALUES 
    (5, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Coffee Beans'), 10),
    (5, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Ice'), 50),
    (5, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Milk'), 90),
    (5, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Water'), 50),
    (5, (SELECT ingredient_id FROM ingredients WHERE ingredient_name = 'Hazelnut Syrup'), 10);
```

### Explanation of Quantities

- **Coffee Beans**: Measured in grams, typically 10g per drink.
- **Ice**: Measured in grams, usually around 50g for iced drinks.
- **Milk**: Measured in milliliters, around 90–100ml for lattes.
- **Water**: Measured in milliliters, around 50–150ml depending on the drink.
- **Syrups**: Measured in milliliters, typically 10ml for a flavored latte.

This setup achieves approximately 200ml per serving and ensures each recipe aligns with the ingredients and drink style. The `recipe_id` will be auto-generated for each `INSERT` command, and each ingredient's `ingredient_id` will be dynamically fetched using subqueries based on the ingredient name.
